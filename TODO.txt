//Create mp1input.txt

Loads the mp1input.txt

Displays heading information to the screen:

define the class of PuzzleState objects:
the puzzle configuration (a numpy 2d array) 
the g/h/f costs, predecessor state reference
the action that was taken to get to this state from the predecessor

Executes the A* algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic
Goal state:
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

Shows the solution in form of the puzzle configurations after each move,
Show move number
action taken
match sample output

Displays the number of states that A* had to visit in order to get to the solution.

* PriorityQueue from the queue package to implement the frontier (open) set.
* implement the __lt__ method in your PuzzleState class.
* Use Pythonâ€™s built-in set object to implement the closed set.
	implement the __hash__ method in your PuzzleState class to do this
